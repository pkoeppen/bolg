# bolg
A tiny blog with zero standards.

### how do?
It's basically a miniature JAM stack generator. Put  Markdown files in `./content`, then do `npm run render`. This will render an `index.html` file next to all blog entries in `./dist`. Voil√†.

### option
There ~~is one whole option~~ are two whole options, nestled appropriately in `config.json`. There is `siteTitle`, which is self-explanatory, and `indexDocument`, which will output each post as `index.html` in its own directory, which is useful for removing the ".html" extension when using static hosting on a platform like AWS S3.

### dnager
Markdown files must have 'title' set in their YAML metadata, and filenames must use kebab-case.
